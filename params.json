Drawing Circle with squares\r\nUsing turtle library\r\n\r\n[Click here](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/blob/master/DrawCirclewithSquares/mindstorms2.py) to see the code.   \r\n\r\nScreenshot of the program output ->\r\n![circleWithSquares.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/master/Image/circle.png)\r\n\r\n## 2. Drawing Flower using Rhombus\r\nUsing turtle library\r\n\r\n[View Code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/blob/master/FlowerWithRhombus/flower.py)\r\n\r\nScreenshot ->\r\n![flower.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/master/Image/flower1.jpg)\r\n\r\n## 3. Find Monthly Pay\r\n\r\nUsing approximation algorithm calculating how much one has to pay each month given initial loan amount and annual compound interest rate to pay off complete amount in 1 year.\r\n\r\n[Here](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/blob/master/FindMinMonthlyPay/findMinMontlyPay.py) is the code for this program.\r\n\r\n## 4. Guess the Number by Computer\r\n\r\nIn this game computer asks us to select any secret number in mind between 1 to 100. Computer is allowed only 7 guesses and yet it always wins. Player has to type 'h', 'l' or 'c' according to the guessed value is high, low or correct.\r\n\r\n[Code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/blob/master/GuessNumber/guessnum.py) of the program.\r\n\r\nHere is the screen shot of program when I choose 21 as my secret number ->\r\n\r\n![guessNumberComputer.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/master/Image/guessNumberComputer.png)\r\n\r\n## 5. Guess the Number by Human\r\n\r\nThis is a complementary version of the above game where computer chooses a secret number and human player has to guess. If range is 0-100 then 7 guesses allowed whereas 10 guesses allowed for range 0-1000. This program uses simplegui library. You can run this program at http://www.codeskulptor.org/.\r\n\r\n[Here](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/blob/master/GuessTheNumber/guessNumber.py) is the code.\r\n\r\nScreenshot of the program when computer chooses 64 secret number ->\r\n![guessNumberHuman.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/master/Image/guessNumberHuman.png)","google":"UA-64574671-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
