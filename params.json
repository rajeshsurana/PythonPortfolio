Word Game\r\n\r\nThis game is a lot like Scrabble or Words With Friends, if you've played those. Letters are dealt to players, who then construct one or more words out of their letters. Each valid word receives a score, based on the length of the word and the letters in that word.\r\n\r\n[Here](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/blob/master/WordGame/ps4b.py) is the code.\r\n\r\nScreenshot of the game while playing->\r\n![wordGame.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/master/Image/wordGame.png)\r\n\r\n## 15. Edx Exam Programs\r\n* Write a Python function that returns a list of keys in aDict with the value target. \r\nThe list of keys you return should be sorted in increasing order. \r\nThe keys and values in aDict are both integers. \r\n(If aDict does not contain the value target, you should return an empty list.)\r\nThis function takes in a dictionary and an integer and returns a list.\r\n[Code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/blob/master/EdxCoursePrograms/keysWithValue.py)\r\n* Write a Python function that returns the sublist of strings in aList that contain fewer than 4 characters. For example, if aList = [\"apple\", \"cat\", \"dog\", \"banana\"], your function should return: [\"cat\", \"dog\"]\r\nThis function takes in a list of strings and returns a list of strings. Your function should not modify aList.\r\n[Code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/blob/master/EdxCoursePrograms/lessThan4.py)\r\n* Write a simple procedure, myLog(x, b), that computes the logarithm of a number x relative to a base b. For example, if x = 16 and b = 2, then the result is 4 - because 2^4=16. If x = 15 and b = 3, then the result is 2 - because 3^2 is the largest power of 3 less than 15.\r\nIn other words, myLog should return the largest power of b such that b to that power is still less than or equal to x.\r\nx and b are both positive integers; b is an integer greater than or equal to 2. Your function should return an integer answer.\r\n[Code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/blob/master/EdxCoursePrograms/myLog.py)\r\n*  Assumes L is a list of strings. Assume function f is already defined for you and it maps a string to a Boolean. Mutates L such that it contains all of the strings, s, originally in L such that f(s) returns True, and no other elements Returns the length of L after mutation.\r\n[Code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/blob/master/EdxCoursePrograms/satisfiesF.py)\r\n* Write a recursive Python function, given a non-negative integer N, to calculate and return the sum of its digits.\r\nHint: Mod (%) by 10 gives you the rightmost digit (126 % 10 is 6), while doing integer division by 10 removes the rightmost digit (126 / 10 is 12).\r\nThis function has to be recursive; you may not use loops!\r\nThis function takes in one integer and returns one integer.\r\n[Code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/blob/master/EdxCoursePrograms/sumDigits.py)\r\n\r\n## 16. Memory Game\r\nMemory is a card game in which the player deals out a set of cards face down. In Memory, a turn (or a move) consists of the player flipping over two cards. If they match, the player leaves them face up. If they don't match, the player flips the cards back face down. The goal of Memory is to end up with all of the cards flipped face up in the minimum number of turns.  A Memory deck consists of eight pairs of matching cards.\r\nThis program uses simplegui library. You can run this program at [http://www.codeskulptor.org/](http://www.codeskulptor.org/).\r\n\r\nHere is the [code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/blob/master/MemoryGame/memory.py).\r\n\r\nScreenshot of the game at start->\r\n![memoryStart.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/master/Image/memoryStart.png)\r\n\r\nIn the middle while playing->\r\n![memoryMid.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/master/Image/memoryMid.png)\r\n\r\nAfter finishing a game->\r\n![memoryEnd.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/master/Image/memoryEnd.png)\r\n\r\n## 17. Caesar Cipher - Cryptography\r\nIn this problem, we will use a variant of the standard Caesar cipher where we will treat upper and lower case letters separately, so upper case letters will always be mapped to upper case letters, and lower case letters will always be mapped to lower case letters. Thus, if \"a\" maps to \"c\", \"A\" will map to \"C\". Characters such as the space character, commas, periods, exclamation points, etc will not be encrypted by this cipher - basically, all the characters within string.punctuation, plus the space (' ') and all numerical characters (0 - 9).\r\n\r\nHere is the [code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/blob/master/Enryption/ps6_encryption.py). \r\n\r\nScreenshot of the program in action->\r\n![cryptography.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/master/Image/cryptography.png)\r\n\r\n## 18. BlackJack Game\r\nBlackjack is a simple, popular card game that is played in many casinos. Cards in Blackjack have the following values: an ace may be valued as either 1 or 11 (player's choice), face cards (kings, queens and jacks) are valued at 10 and the value of the remaining cards corresponds to their number. During a round of Blackjack, the players plays against a dealer with the goal of building a hand (a collection of cards) whose cards have a total value that is higher than the value of the dealer's hand, but not over 21.  (A round of Blackjack is also sometimes referred to as a hand.)\r\n\r\nHere is the [code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/blob/master/BlackJack/BlackJack.py).\r\n\r\nScreenshot of the program in action->\r\n![BlackJack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/master/Image/BlackJack.png)\r\n\r\n## 19. Asteroids Game\r\nThis is the updated version of Asteroids game which is an arcade space shooter released in November 1979 by Atari, Inc. The player controls a spaceship in an asteroid field which is periodically traversed by flying saucers. The object of the game is to shoot and destroy asteroids and saucers while not colliding with either or being hit by the saucers' counter-fire. The game becomes harder as the number of asteroids increases. For this game we don't have flying saucers. This program uses simplegui library to implement GUI.\r\n\r\nHere is the [code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/blob/master/Asteroids/asteroids.py).\r\n\r\nScreenshot of game's home screen->\r\n![Asteroid Home Screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/master/Image/asteroidHome.png)\r\n\r\nScreeshot of the game in action->\r\n![Asteroid game in action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/master/Image/asteroidPlaying.png)\r\n\r\n## 20. RSS News Feed for Google and Yahoo\r\nMany websites have content that is updated on an unpredictable schedule. News sites, such as Google News, are a good example of this. One tedious way to keep track of this changing content is to load the website up in your browser, and periodically hit the refresh button. Fortunately, this process can be streamlined and automated by connecting to the website's RSS feed, using an RSS feed reader instead of a web browser (e.g. Sage). An RSS reader will periodically collect and draw your attention to updated content.\r\n\r\n[Code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/blob/master/RSSNewsFeed/ps7.py) can be found here.\r\n\r\nScreen shot of the newsfeed->\r\n![RSS News Feed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/master/Image/newsFeed.png)\r\n\r\n## 21. Unique Values from Dictionary\r\nYou are given a dictionary aDict that maps integer keys to integer values. Write a Python function that returns a list of keys in aDict that map to dictionary values that appear exactly once in aDict.\r\n\r\n* This function takes in a dictionary and returns a list.\r\n* Return the list of keys in increasing order.\r\n* If aDict does not contain any values appearing exactly once, return an empty list.\r\n* If aDict is empty, return an empty list.\r\n\r\nSolution code can be found [here](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/blob/master/UniqueValues/uniqueVal.py).\r\n\r\n## 22. Family Tree\r\nConsider a following tree->\r\n\r\n![Family Tree Graphics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/master/Image/familyTreeGraphics.png)\r\n\r\n* zeroth cousin: If two nodes are siblings (have the same immediately preceding ancestor, such as nodes \"H\" and \"I\") they are zeroth cousins.\r\n* first cousin: Children of zeroth cousins are first cousins.\r\n* second cousin: Grandchildren of zeroth cousins are second cousins.\r\n* In general, i'th cousins have a grandparent or ancestor that is i levels up from their parents.\r\n\r\nSuppose two people, P1 and P2, are i'th cousins. Let C1 be a child of P1 and C2 be a child of P2. Then, C1 is an i'th cousin of P2, 1 removed, and C2 is an i'th cousin of P1, 1 removed.\r\nLet G1 now be a child of C1. G1 is an i'th cousin of P2, 2 removed.\r\nIn general, the type of cousin (what 'i' is) is the shorter distance to the ancestor of two people, and the amount removed is the difference between the distance to the common ancestor.\r\n\r\nClass Member is a class that represents a single person in the family, and Class Family represents the whole family tree.\r\n\r\nYou are to write code for the method cousin of the class Family according to the docstring in FamilyTree.py and the definitions for degree removed and cousin type.\r\n\r\nHere is the [solution code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/blob/master/FamilyTree/FamilyTree.py).\r\n\r\nSnapshot of the program output->\r\n![Family Tree](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/master/Image/familyTree.png)","google":"UA-64574671-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
