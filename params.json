Drawing Circle with squares\r\nUsing turtle library\r\n\r\n[Click here](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/blob/master/DrawCirclewithSquares/mindstorms2.py) to see the code.   \r\n\r\nScreenshot of the program output ->\r\n![circleWithSquares.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/master/Image/circle.png)\r\n\r\n## 2. Drawing Flower using Rhombus\r\nUsing turtle library\r\n\r\n[View Code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/blob/master/FlowerWithRhombus/flower.py)\r\n\r\nScreenshot ->\r\n![flower.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/master/Image/flower1.jpg)\r\n\r\n## 3. Find Monthly Pay\r\n\r\nUsing approximation algorithm calculating how much one has to pay each month given initial loan amount and annual compound interest rate to pay off complete amount in 1 year.\r\n\r\n[Here](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/blob/master/FindMinMonthlyPay/findMinMontlyPay.py) is the code for this program.\r\n\r\n## 4. Guess the Number by Computer\r\n\r\nIn this game computer asks us to select any secret number in mind between 1 to 100. Computer is allowed only 7 guesses and yet it always wins. Player has to type 'h', 'l' or 'c' according to the guessed value is high, low or correct.\r\n\r\n[Code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/blob/master/GuessNumber/guessnum.py) of the program.\r\n\r\nHere is the screen shot of program when I choose 21 as my secret number ->\r\n\r\n![guessNumberComputer.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/master/Image/guessNumberComputer.png)\r\n\r\n## 5. Guess the Number by Human\r\n\r\nThis is a complementary version of the above game where computer chooses a secret number and human player has to guess. If range is 0-100 then 7 guesses allowed whereas 10 guesses allowed for range 0-1000. This program uses simplegui library. You can run this program at http://www.codeskulptor.org/.\r\n\r\n[Here](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/blob/master/GuessTheNumber/guessNumber.py) is the code.\r\n\r\nScreenshot of the program when computer chooses 64 secret number ->\r\n![guessNumberHuman.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/master/Image/guessNumberHuman.png)\r\n\r\n## 6. Hangman game (Text Version)\r\n\r\nThis is a classic game of guessing word letter by letter within some finite chances.\r\n\r\n[Here](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/blob/master/Hangman/ps3_hangman.py) is the code. \r\n\r\nScreenshot of the game ->\r\n![Hangman.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/master/Image/Hangman.png)\r\n\r\n## 7. Longest Alphabetical Sequence\r\n\r\nThis program takes input as any one string and finds longest alphabetical sequence.\r\n\r\n[Here](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/blob/master/Logest_alphabetical_seq/longest_alphabetical_seq.py) is the code.\r\n\r\n## 8. Movie Trailers Showcase\r\n\r\nThis program creates a webpage showcasing my favorite movie trailers in a browser.\r\n\r\n[Here](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/tree/master/Movies) is the code. \r\n\r\nScreenshot of the webpage generated when program is executed.\r\n![Movies.png](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/blob/master/Image/MovieTrailers.png)\r\n\r\n## 9. Classic Arcade Pong game\r\n\r\nThis is the classic arcade game Pong. This game can be played here [http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user40_DWG0hswoqwI7kJQ.py](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user40_DWG0hswoqwI7kJQ.py).\r\n\r\n[Here](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/blob/master/PongGame/Pong.py) is the code. \r\n\r\nScreenshot of the game->\r\n![pong.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/master/Image/pong.png)\r\n\r\n## 10. Profanity Editor\r\n\r\nGiven any text file this program checks whether there are any curse words in the file or not. If any curse word is found then program returns the alert message.\r\n\r\n[Code](https://github.com/rajeshsurana/PythonPortfolio/blob/master/PrafanityEditor/check_profanity.py) can be found here.","google":"UA-64574671-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
